# CTSpinoPelvic1K — Roadmap, Projects & Publication Deadlines

> **Scheme note (2026-09-03).** CTSpinoPelvic1K's label scheme is bone and hardware only. The soft-tissue aims below (LS nerves, iliolumbar ligament, psoas, vessels) are future, separate annotation layers; if released they take fresh identifiers above the hardware block, never the retired 58-73 range (see `scripts/label_scheme.py`, `RETIRED_IDS`).

Single source of truth for project goals and submission targets. Dates verified
as of 2026-06-21; ✅ = confirmed from the venue, ⚠️ = extrapolated from the prior
year (verify on the live CFP before relying on it).

## Dataset versions

| Version | Contents | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **v1** | full release (all configs) | published (HF `@v1`) |
| **v2** | radiologist spine GT + pseudolabelled pelves (L1–L6, sacrum, hips, ignore) | published (HF `@v2`) |
| **v3** | v2 + **femurs (32/33) + carved S1 (29) + GT thoracic (8–19, 28)**; VerSe-native scheme; ribs reserved-but-empty | **rebuild in progress** — pipeline fixed (per-case `/tmp` cleanup + fail-fast + resume-on-ok); clean run then push to `@v3` **and** `@main` |
| **v4** (planned) | v3 + **ribs + LS nerves + iliolumbar ligament + VerSeFusion anomalies** | annotation phase (student tasks below) |

Label scheme + build logic: [`scripts/build_v3_totalseg.py`](../scripts/build_v3_totalseg.py).
Ship pipeline: [`slurm/ship_v3.sh`](../slurm/ship_v3.sh) (build → push `@v3` → promote `@main`).

## Projects

One project = one paper. Each paper's **aims** are concrete deliverables.

### Paper 1 — CTSpinoPelvic1K v3 (bone) dataset
*Deadline: **MLHC 2026** — in review, score 2.75/4 (conf Aug 12–14, 2026). Backups:
BIBM (no dual-submission while MLHC pending), ML4H Findings (non-archival), Scientific
Data (durable citation).*
- **Aim 1:** Build v3 — add femurs + carve S1 + GT thoracic onto v2.
- **Aim 2:** Baseline nnU-Net (pseudolabels L1–L5 + sacrum) + the reviewer-requested ablation.
- **Aim 3:** Publish v3 to HF (`@v3`, promote `@main`).

### Paper 2 — Spinopelvic parameters from CT masks (OpenSpineToolkit)
*Deadline: **BIBM 2026 — Jul 5** (full paper), or **SPIE Medical Imaging 2027 —
abstract Aug 5, 2026** (mss Jan 27, 2027). Independent of MLHC. Other homes: JOSS /
J. Imaging Informatics in Medicine / Operative Neurosurgery.*
Spec: [OpenSpineToolkit `SPEC.md`](https://github.com/Gregory-Schwing-MD-PhD/OpenSpineToolkit/blob/main/SPEC.md) (PI first — posture-invariant → valid on supine CT).
- **Aim 1:** Develop PI extraction code (femoral-head sphere-fit + S1 endplate + sagittal projection).
- **Aim 2:** Manually verify PI (MAE / ICC / Bland–Altman vs manual).
- **Aim 3:** Extend to LL + PI–LL mismatch (develop + verify).

### Paper 3 — Lumbosacral nerve segmentation & Kambin's-triangle mapping
*Deadline: **MICCAI 2027** (~Feb) / **MIDL 2027** (~Dec 2026); clinical: AJNR /
World Neurosurgery; ML4H 2027.* Precedent: Fan 2019 (SPINECT, CT, Dice 0.905);
clinical motivation: Tabarestani 2023 (MRI, percLIF).
- **Aim 1:** Annotate L4/L5/S1 nerve roots on v3 (student task + IRR).
- **Aim 2:** Train + validate a per-root nerve segmentation model (vs MRI subset).
- **Aim 3:** Derive Kambin's-triangle / foraminal geometry + LSTV neural enumeration
  (L5-nerve caliber/count at the lateral sacrum).

### Paper 4 — v4 dataset: ribs, iliolumbar ligament & LSTV/TLTV detection
*Deadline: **BIBM 2027** (~Jul) / **Scientific Data** (rolling, v4 descriptor) /
**MICCAI 2027**.* Three independent enumeration anchors: rostral bony (lowest
rib-bearing vertebra), caudal bony (S1 endplate + Castellvi morphology), neural
(L5-nerve caliber + iliolumbar ligament, which arises from the L5 TP).
- **Aim 1:** Segment ribs on v3 (student task; numbering read from GT thoracic).
- **Aim 2:** Segment the iliolumbar ligament (student task).
- **Aim 3:** LSTV/TLTV detection from the three anchors (rib-status ↔ GT-numbering
  mismatch flags candidates; GT stays authoritative) + VerSeFusion augmentation
  (~50 more LSTV/TLTV; n=33 → ~83, annotated in the v3 scheme); publish v4.

## Venue deadline matrix

| Venue | Deadline | Event | Type | For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MLHC 2026** | ✅ Apr 17, 2026 (closed) | ✅ Aug 12–14, Baltimore | archival | P1 (in review) |
| **IEEE BIBM 2026** | ✅ **Jul 5, 2026** | ✅ Dec 1–4, Dallas | archival (IEEE Xplore) | P2; P1 fallback |
| **SPIE Medical Imaging 2027** | ✅ **Abstract 5 Aug 2026** · notif 26 Oct 2026 · mss 27 Jan 2027 | ✅ Feb 14–18, 2027, Vancouver | archival | P2; P1/P4; P3 (if early) |
| **ML4H 2026 (Findings)** | ⚠️ ~Sep 2026 (2025 = Sep 8) | ~Dec 2026 | **non-archival** | P1/P2 visibility |
| **MIDL 2027** | ⚠️ ~Dec 2026 (verify) | 2027 | archival | P3 |
| **MICCAI 2027** | ⚠️ ~Feb 2027 (verify) | 2027 | archival | P3, P4 |
| **Rolling journals** | none | — | journal | Scientific Data (P1/P4); J. Imaging Informatics in Medicine / JOSS / Operative Neurosurgery (P2); AJNR / World Neurosurgery (P3) |

**Confirmed PASSED (do not chase):** MICCAI 2026 (full mss Feb 26, 2026), MIDL 2026
(full Dec 2025 / short Apr 15, 2026).

**Near-term archival slots (two):**
1. **BIBM — Jul 5, 2026** (full paper). Best candidate = **P2 (toolbox)**: independent
   of MLHC, PI/LL pipeline is self-contained. P1 only if MLHC rejects first.
2. **SPIE Medical Imaging 2027 — abstract Aug 5, 2026** (only a **2–4 page PDF** at
   this stage; full manuscript not due until Jan 27, 2027 — a much lower near-term
   bar). Two on-target conferences: **MI102 Image Processing** (lists "open software
   for medical image processing" and "ground truth generation / validation" — fits
   P1 dataset *and* P2 toolbox) and **MI103 Computer-Aided Diagnosis** (clinical-AI /
   imaging-biomarker / musculoskeletal+neurology — fits P2's surgical-utility angle).
   Has a **student paper award** — good for the med-student contributors. Strong,
   low-risk near-term play for P2 (and a P1/P4 abstract).

## Student annotation tasks (v4) — see `docs/annotation/`

| Task | Difficulty | Output | Anchor role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ribs** | easier (TS-assisted; value-add = numbering + partials) | rib masks 34–57 | rostral enumeration |
| **Iliolumbar ligament** | moderate (CT-friendly; sometimes ossified) | ligament mask | LSTV cross-check |
| **LS nerves** | hard (per-root instance; CT contrast-limited) | per-root nerve instances | Kambin's + neural enumeration |

All tasks: **AI-assisted** annotation + **dual-assignment IRR** (per-class Dice,
adjudication on disagreement) via the `review_service/` pipeline. Reference standard
needs an **expert adjudicator**; validate nerves vs MRI where paired imaging exists.

## Sequencing principle

Publish the **dataset once** (v3 → MLHC/Scientific Data); model improvements are
**separate** method/benchmark papers that *cite* it (not re-publications). A new
dataset paper is justified when the data **materially expands** — i.e. **v4
(+ribs +nerves +iliolumbar +VerSeFusion)** is the next dataset paper.

## Prone/supine as a design constraint, not a nuisance

**Mixing prone and supine acquisitions biases any measurement taken across the cohort.**
Position changes lumbar lordosis and segmental alignment, so a value measured on a prone
series and one measured on a supine series are not the same quantity. This is the same fact
the Methods section leans on to justify the crosswalk -- a label drawn on one series is the
wrong *shape* for the other, not merely out of position -- and it applies just as forcefully
to the numbers derived from those labels.

For the clinical study the consequence is that both acquisitions of a patient have to be
pseudolabelled, and every reported value has to name the position it was measured in.

**The cohort is already built for this.** Every patient in CT COLONOGRAPHY was scanned twice,
and **351 patients** have their two annotations on *different* series -- the `separate`
configuration, held out by design rather than merged. That is a paired within-patient design
with the position as the only deliberate difference, which is exactly what is needed to
measure **flexion-extension mobility** segment by segment.

So the bias and the opportunity are the same fact. A cohort that must not be pooled across
position is a cohort that can measure what position does.

### What this needs

1. Pseudolabel both acquisitions for the paired patients, not just the one that carries the
   annotation.
2. Report every spinopelvic parameter with its position, and never pool across it.
3. Then the mobility study: per-segment angular change between the two positions, on 351
   pairs.
